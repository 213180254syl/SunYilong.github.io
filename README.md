## Welcome to Sun Yilong's Personal Website!

Welcome! My name is Yilong and I am a junior undergraduate in the School of Information Science and Engineering of Southeast University. Before I transferred to the School of Information Science and Engineering, I studied in the School of Physics for one year.

My research interests lie in design of analog and mixed signal circuits. I've done some work on the wideband reconfigurable anti-interference receiver and software defined radio simulation toolbox. Here I have listed my CV and transcript in order to let you know more about me.
